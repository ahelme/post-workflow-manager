## Current Session Notes

- [7:07:21 pm] [Unknown User] Excel Format Mismatch Discovery: Found the root cause! Excel reports "mismatch between filetype and file extension" for both .xlsx and .xls files generated by our XLSX library. This means the library isn't generating files that Excel fully recognizes as valid Excel format. Need to try CSV approach or different Excel generation method for maximum compatibility.
- [6:58:10 pm] [Unknown User] Excel Export Debugging Session: Systematically debugging Excel export compatibility issues. Found that our generated Excel files (.xlsx) are technically valid (recognized as Microsoft Excel 2007+ format by `file` command and readable by Node.js XLSX library). The issue appears to be with complex formatting options in our export function. 

**Tested approaches:**
1. ‚úÖ Verified existing Excel files are valid format and readable by XLSX library
2. ‚úÖ Created simplified test export function that works successfully
3. üîÑ Currently simplifying the main backup.js export function by:
   - Removing complex date parsing (just using String conversion)
   - Removing control character cleaning 
   - Will next test removing cellStyles/cellText/cellHTML options
   - Will test removing column width settings
   - Will test removing compression: false option

**Key finding:** The Excel files we generate ARE valid - the issue is likely specific Excel version compatibility or over-complex formatting options making some versions of Excel display warnings/errors even though the file is technically correct.
- [6:52:11 pm] [Unknown User] PostFlow Rebranding Complete: Successfully rebranded the entire application from "Film Post-Production Management System" to "PostFlow". Updated package.json, README.md, HTML metadata, and all navigation components. The app now consistently displays "PostFlow" throughout the user interface. Created comprehensive Implementation_Phases.md document outlining current status and roadmap including the planned yellow shadcn UI theme implementation.
- [6:46:22 pm] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [6:40:58 pm] [Unknown User] Working on Excel Export Compatibility Issues: Currently debugging Excel file compatibility problems where exported backup files cause errors when opening in Excel.

## Issues Encountered:
1. **File Extension Error**: "Unrecognized bookType |excel|" - FIXED by mapping 'excel' format to '.xlsx' extension in generateFilename()
2. **Excel File Error**: Files generate successfully but Excel reports file errors when opening - STILL INVESTIGATING

## Attempted Solutions:
- ‚úÖ Fixed file extension mapping ('excel' ‚Üí '.xlsx')
- üîÑ Enhanced Excel export with robust formatting:
  - Safe date formatting (ISO YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - Text cleaning to remove control characters
  - Proper null value handling
  - Professional column width settings
  - Excel-specific file generation options (bookType: 'xlsx', compression: false)
  - Added cellStyles, cellText, and cellHTML options for worksheet creation

## Current Status:
- Excel backup files are being generated with .xlsx extension
- Files still trigger errors when opened in Excel (format/compatibility issue)
- Import/export functionality framework is in place
- Sample template (Import_Sample.xlsx) exists and may be working

## Next Steps to Try:
- Test if the enhanced formatting resolves Excel compatibility
- May need to investigate specific Excel version compatibility
- Could try alternative xlsx library options or different data formatting approaches
