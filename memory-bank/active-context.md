## Current Session Notes

- [6:46:22 pm] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [6:40:58 pm] [Unknown User] Working on Excel Export Compatibility Issues: Currently debugging Excel file compatibility problems where exported backup files cause errors when opening in Excel.

## Issues Encountered:
1. **File Extension Error**: "Unrecognized bookType |excel|" - FIXED by mapping 'excel' format to '.xlsx' extension in generateFilename()
2. **Excel File Error**: Files generate successfully but Excel reports file errors when opening - STILL INVESTIGATING

## Attempted Solutions:
- ‚úÖ Fixed file extension mapping ('excel' ‚Üí '.xlsx')
- üîÑ Enhanced Excel export with robust formatting:
  - Safe date formatting (ISO YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - Text cleaning to remove control characters
  - Proper null value handling
  - Professional column width settings
  - Excel-specific file generation options (bookType: 'xlsx', compression: false)
  - Added cellStyles, cellText, and cellHTML options for worksheet creation

## Current Status:
- Excel backup files are being generated with .xlsx extension
- Files still trigger errors when opened in Excel (format/compatibility issue)
- Import/export functionality framework is in place
- Sample template (Import_Sample.xlsx) exists and may be working

## Next Steps to Try:
- Test if the enhanced formatting resolves Excel compatibility
- May need to investigate specific Excel version compatibility
- Could try alternative xlsx library options or different data formatting approaches
