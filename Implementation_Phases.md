### Major Achievements Completed
- ✅ **PostFlow Rebranding**: Complete app rename from "Film Post-Production Management System"
- ✅ **Excel Export/Import Resolution**: Completely solved Excel compatibility issues
- ✅ **UI Theme Upgrade**: Yellow shadcn UI theme implementation COMPLETED
- ✅ **Admin System**: Database reset functionality with double confirmation dialogs

### Excel Export/Import - BREAKTHROUGH SUCCESS! 🎉
#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue 1**: ISO timestamps like `"2025-09-10T02:44:32.035Z"` broke Excel parser (colons, T character)
- **Issue 2**: Quotation marks in text fields confused Excel's format detection
- **Issue 3**: Database timestamps not needed for end users anyway

#### Final Solution Implemented
- ✅ **Remove timestamp fields** (createdAt, updatedAt) from exports
- ✅ **Strip quotation marks** from all text fields using cleanText() function
- ✅ **Maintain business data** (project details, student info, production dates)
- ✅ **Use XLSX library defaults** for maximum compatibility

#### Excel Import Testing Results
- ✅ **Full import cycle works** - export to Excel, import back successfully
- ✅ **Data validation** with proper error handling and feedback
- ✅ **Database transactions** ensure data integrity
- ✅ **Smart updates** - updates existing records, creates new ones
- ✅ **Relationship handling** - proper student-project associations
