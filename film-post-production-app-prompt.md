- **Student Details**: Name, Student ID, contact information, year/program
- **Production Team**: Supervising producer, director, editor, sound engineer
- **Critical Dates**: 
  - Shoot date
  - Grade date (color correction)
  - Mix date (audio post)
  - Rushes delivery date
  - Final delivery date
  - Review/screening dates
- **Project Status**: Pre-production, Shooting, Post-production, Grading, Audio Mix, Complete
- **Equipment/Resources**: Camera equipment used, editing suite assignments
- **Notes/Comments**: Free-form text for additional project information

### Technical Specifications
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity (easily portable, no server setup required)
- **Frontend**: Modern responsive web interface (React/Vue.js recommended)
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/Flask
- **Authentication**: Simple user management (admin/student/producer roles)
- **File Handling**: Support for attaching project files, thumbnails, documents

### User Interface Requirements
- **Dashboard**: Overview of all projects with status indicators
- **Project List**: Sortable/filterable table view
- **Project Detail**: Individual project management page
- **Calendar View**: Visual timeline of all critical dates
- **Search/Filter**: By student, status, date ranges, supervising producer
- **Bulk Operations**: Update multiple projects simultaneously
- **Data Export**: PDF reports, CSV exports for external use

### Backup System
- **Configurable Schedules**: Daily, weekly, monthly automatic backups
- **Backup Types**: 
  - Full database backup
  - Incremental backups
  - Export to multiple formats (JSON, CSV, SQL)
- **Storage Options**: Local storage, cloud storage (Google Drive/Dropbox integration)
- **Restore Functionality**: Easy restoration from backup files
- **Backup Notifications**: Email alerts on successful/failed backups

### Additional Features
- **Email Notifications**: Automated reminders for upcoming deadlines
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for project completion stages
- **Resource Scheduling**: Avoid conflicts in equipment/facility booking
- **Reporting**: Generate reports by semester, student, or project type
- **Data Validation**: Ensure required fields are completed
- **Audit Trail**: Track changes and who made them

## Technical Implementation Suggestions

### Development Stack Options
1. **Full-Stack JavaScript**: 
   - Frontend: React/Next.js
   - Backend: Node.js/Express
   - Database: SQLite with Sequelize ORM
   
2. **Python Stack**:
   - Frontend: React + REST API
   - Backend: Flask/FastAPI
   - Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy

3. **All-in-One Solution**:
   - Use a framework like Django with built-in admin interface
   - SQLite database
   - Bootstrap/Tailwind for responsive design

### Development Priorities
1. **Phase 1**: Core CRUD operations, basic UI, project management
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced filtering, calendar views, user authentication
3. **Phase 3**: Backup system, notifications, reporting features
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features like resource scheduling, bulk operations

### Deployment Considerations
- **Local Network**: Deploy on school server for internal access
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for easy setup/maintenance
- **Data Migration**: Tool to import existing Excel data
- **Documentation**: User manual and technical documentation
- **Training**: Simple interface requiring minimal technical knowledge

## Security & Data Protection
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with appropriate role permissions
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Backup Encryption**: Secure backup storage
- **Access Logs**: Track who accessed/modified what data
- **GDPR Compliance**: Consider data protection requirements for student information

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time spent on project tracking
- Improved deadline adherence through automated reminders
- Better visibility into post-production pipeline
- Simplified reporting for administration
- Reduced data entry errors compared to Excel

This web application will streamline your film school's post-production workflow, providing better organization, automated reminders, and comprehensive backup solutions while maintaining the flexibility you currently enjoy with Excel.
